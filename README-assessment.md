This evaluation on terraform will create an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster, enable Route 53 DNS management, and set up a custom VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). It also has a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a Golang application on the EKS cluster.

Components
1. EKS Cluster
An EKS cluster was created to run containerized Golang applications.
The cluster is deployed in a multi-node configuration to ensure high availability and scalability.
Networking and security management are performed in the custom VPC to integrate with the EKS Cluster.
2. VPC Configuration
A custom VPC was then created to isolate the network resources needed for the EKS cluster.
Redundant subnets were set up in multiple Availability Zones for both public and private.
The inbound and outbound traffic into the cluster was controlled with the help of Security Groups and Network ACLs.
3. Route 53 Integrated
The Golang service's DNS was managed by AWS Route 53.
A Hosted Zone was created, and an A record was added to point to the external IP of the LoadBalancer.
This allows friendly access of domain name to the Golang service from an external client.
4. Kubernetes Manifest
Created a Kubernetes manifest to deploy the Golang service on the EKS cluster.
The manifest holds:
Deployment: Specifies the number of replicas, Docker image, resource limits, and probes for the Golang application.
Service - An internal service in the cluster exposed to the outside as a LoadBalancer.

Resources
EKS Cluster Setup: This cluster is created using Terraform with the resources needed that involves nodes, VPC, and the security setup.
Route 53 Configuration: Route traffic to the Golang service through the management of DNS with AWS Route 53. Apply Kubernetes Manifest:
